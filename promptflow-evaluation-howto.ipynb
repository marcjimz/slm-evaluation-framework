    "# Built-in Promptflow Evaluators and Application Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "The PromptFlow Evaluation Framework provides a suite of built-in evaluators designed to assess the performance and safety of language models across various application scenarios. These evaluators are categorized based on the type of assessment they perform, ranging from the quality of generated content to its safety and appropriateness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question and Answer\n",
    "This scenario caters to applications that involve posing queries and generating responses. It is ideal for evaluating the model's ability to understand and process information accurately to provide relevant answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat\n",
    "This scenario is tailored for applications where the model engages in dialogue, employing a retrieval-augmented approach. It assesses the model's capability to extract pertinent information from provided documents and generate coherent, detailed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Evaluator Categories and Their Technical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Each evaluator is meticulously crafted to cater to specific technical scenarios and requirements. For example, the **RelevanceEvaluator** necessitates a `question`, `answer`, and `context` to ascertain the relevance of the provided answer to the posed question within the specified context. This evaluator is indispensable for applications such as virtual assistants or customer support chatbots, where the pertinence of responses critically influences user satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating Q/A Pairs for Accuracy and Coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's dive into how we can check out a Q/A pair, especially when we want to see how a user's answer stacks up against the real deal (aka the ground truth). Here are the key players you'll want to bring into the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SimilarityEvaluator**: This tool scrutinizes the congruence between the user's answer and the ground truth. It is instrumental in gauging how well the user's response aligns with the expected answer, a feature paramount for platforms like educational portals where precision is of the essence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1ScoreEvaluator**: This evaluator computes the F1 score by examining the overlap between the user's answer and the ground truth. It offers invaluable insights into the precision (the relevance of the user's answer) and recall (the extent to which the ground truth is encapsulated by the user's answer), thereby facilitating a nuanced understanding of response accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RelevanceEvaluator**: Traditionally employed to evaluate the relevance of an answer to the given question and context, it can also be adeptly used to measure how pertinent the user's answer is in relation to the ground truth, especially in contexts where the backdrop of the question significantly influences the accuracy of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CoherenceEvaluator**: This evaluator is essential for assessing the logical flow and coherence of the user's answer vis-à-vis the ground truth. It ensures that the response not only corresponds with the expected answer but also exhibits logical consistency and coherence, crucial for elaborate answers necessitating detailed explanation or justification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prioritizing Content Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the **ContentSafetyEvaluator** and **ContentSafetyChatEvaluator** play a critical role in applications that emphasize user safety, like social media platforms or community forums. These evaluators are dedicated to ensuring that generated content is devoid of any harmful or inappropriate material, safeguarding the community against potential risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhanced framework for evaluator categories and their applications underscores the importance of tailored evaluations in enhancing the accuracy, relevance, and safety of responses across various digital platforms.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Scenario 2: Integration of Custom Evaluation with Built-in PromptFlow for Enhanced Contextual Accuracy in Q&A Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: To enhance the evaluation of our AI bot's (LLM/SLM) performance in responding to user queries, we have developed a custom evaluation framework. This framework focuses on the accuracy of responses and their contextual understanding, utilizing a predefined ground truth for comparison. It is designed to complement and extend the built-in evaluation methods provided by PromptFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Evaluation Framework**:\n",
    "- **Implementation**: We have implemented a custom evaluation module, `SemanticSimilarityEvaluator`, leveraging the `transformers` library to utilize pre-trained models for semantic similarity assessments.\n",
    "- **Functionality**: This module calculates the semantic similarity between the AI bot's response and the ground truth. It uses embeddings generated by a pre-trained model (`bert-base-uncased`) and computes cosine similarity to quantify semantic closeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration with PromptFlow**:\n",
    "- Our custom evaluation is seamlessly integrated with PromptFlow's built-in evaluation methods. This combination allows for a comprehensive assessment that covers both the nuanced contextual understanding and the accuracy of the AI bot's responses.\n",
    "- **Input**: User queries across various topics and complexities.\n",
    "- **AI Bot**: Our system, tasked with generating responses.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Criteria**:\n",
    "  - **Contextual Understanding**: Assesses the AI bot's grasp of the query's context and intent.\n",
    "  - **Response Accuracy**: Measures the alignment of the AI bot's responses with the expected answers, enriched by our custom semantic similarity evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: To ascertain the efficacy of our AI bot in providing contextually accurate and precise responses, leveraging both our custom evaluation and PromptFlow's built-in methods to highlight areas for improvement and ensure comprehensive coverage of evaluation metrics."
